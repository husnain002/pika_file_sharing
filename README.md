*Share files from your phone with Pok√©mon flair!*

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Pikachu FileSync uses Python's `http.server` and `socketserver` to create a local web server. The custom `FileSharingHandler` class handles:
- **GET Requests**: Serves a mobile-responsive HTML page or files.
- **POST Requests**: Processes file uploads from phones or computers.
- **Local IP Detection**: Automatically finds your machine's IP for easy access from any device.

The UI is optimized for mobile devices, with touch-friendly buttons and a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless experience for phone users.
The EXE version is a self-contained executable (bundled with PyInstaller) that runs the same server without Python. The UI is mobile-optimized with touch-friendly buttons and a responsive layout.

## üì± EXE and Mobile Sharing Tips
- **EXE Usage**: The EXE is for Windows users who want a quick setup. Download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/husnain002/pikachu-filesync/releases) page.
- **Mobile Access**: Ensure your phone and the server computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Firewall**: The EXE may prompt for firewall access to allow network traffic on port `8080`.
- **Large Files**: Modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari) handle uploads well, but older browsers may have limitations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- The server runs on port `8080` by default. Change the `PORT` variable in `filesync.py` if needed.
- Files are stored in the current working directory. Ensure you have write permissions.
- This is designed for local network use. Do not expose to the public internet without proper security measures.
- Some older phone browsers may have limitations with large file uploads.
- The EXE is Windows-only; use the Python version for other OSes.
