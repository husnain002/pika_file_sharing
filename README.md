*Share files from your phone with Pokémon flair!*

## 🛠️ How It Works
Pikachu FileSync uses Python's `http.server` and `socketserver` to create a local web server. The custom `FileSharingHandler` class handles:
- **GET Requests**: Serves a mobile-responsive HTML page or files.
- **POST Requests**: Processes file uploads from phones or computers.
- **Local IP Detection**: Automatically finds your machine's IP for easy access from any device.

The UI is optimized for mobile devices, with touch-friendly buttons and a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless experience for phone users.

## 📱 Mobile Sharing Tips
- Ensure your phone and the server computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- If the server address doesn’t work, check your firewall settings to allow traffic on port `8080`.
- For large files, ensure your phone’s browser supports uploads (modern browsers like Chrome and Safari work well).

## ⚠️ Notes
- The server runs on port `8080` by default. Change the `PORT` variable in `filesync.py` if needed.
- Files are stored in the current working directory. Ensure you have write permissions.
- This is designed for local network use. Do not expose to the public internet without proper security measures.
- Some older phone browsers may have limitations with large file uploads.
